4-1-152j

    need to add 'it' version FD Clock options back to this version
    
    added 900 to .band command
    added .timeok to .h help command
    added ? help note to startup
    compacted startup lines on GUI
    adjusted comments
    added signature to console QSTs -logger
    display UDP and TCP ports (only showed UDP before and didn't note protocol)

4-1-152i fingerprint 9738da

    added QST bells (noise) and copy to console
    this was used in FD2014 (also an 'it' version used)

4-1-152h fingerprint 62169f

    made a new packaging program (packager.py), added fingerprinting to it
    reduced writes of offset to database
    added more info at shutdown time, directed user to close console after app finishes
    added more delays during shutdown
    tightened tdwin default to 5 (even over internet 2 is enough)
    added os exit call after shutdown to clear dangling items

4-1-152g fingerprint ends in 146e5

    preparing for FD2014, shared this version to HSFDG for testing 5/26
    added W6AKB's GPS Station Clock
      this is a GPS with PPS, a Teensy2 with USB, a ChronoDot and some displays
      design and PC boards will be available
      it delives millisecond accurate time via USB
      and provides readouts of UTC and Local Time on several displays
      FDLog searches the first 20 COM channels for it
        if either there is no serial library or it doesn't find it
        the GPS Clock it gives up
        FDLot will only use the GPS Clock time when locked to GPS
    separated time master from how the station gets time
      only one master, it advertises level 0
        set by .set tmast <nodeid> as before
        regardless of how the master node gets time
        master node sends time only status broadcasts at 1hz
      if a station is not master and has a GPS clock it can advertise level 1
      if a station has a defined accurate clock it can advertise 2
        turn on with .timeok 1, off with .timeok 0, stored in local database
      stations add 3 to their source to report their own time level
    added defined accurate time flag for each station (.timeok 0/1)
      indicates system time is accurate (and offset is zero)
      stored in local database like operator, logger, power, debug
      smoothly transitions to offset zero
    add gps clock flag for each station (did auto find instead)
      drives local offset from gps clock readings
    it doesn't make sense to have both as this would drive
      the offset to zero and to a value...
      so one must take priority over the other
      the gps clock takes priority since it is verifiable..
      then drops to timeok if true and gps clock not locked
    time master now sends out time-only broadcasts at 1hz
      in addition to the usual 10 second full info status broadcast
    fixed startup clock offset read from database (old bug fixed)
    makes smooth transition between modes (offset transitions at most 0.1s per second

4-1-152f added 900 to band command

    added 900 to .ba command
    band command titles fixed
    comments updated
    probably FD2013 version (for many to most stations)
    
4-1-152e vhf cabrillo output 5/30/2013

    making ba command smarter, filtering for newest info on each station
    limit age growth on info to 999 min (999 minutes old max)
    .ba command shows time since last Q (tslq) in minutes instead of time of last Q (tmlq)
    .ba command tslq now in hhmm units
    added cabrillo for vhf contest to saved entry file
    added .set grid <grid> for 4 character grid entry
    
4-1-152d port change and cleanup 5/2013

    changed shutting down comment
    edited other comments
    added startup info about remote mode capable
    fixing date
    note that dates on version line were 2013/05/12, forgot to edit that
    .ba command formatting improved and information filtered
    changed to tcp port 5100 (yahoo webcam) to be compatible with work firewall
    changed indicatoron in band buttons to 1 which changes look but works better on mac
    detected os.name and made indicatoron for posix os (mac and likely linux)

4-1-152c minor cleanup 5/2013

    made storing globals to database automatic when commands processed
    made shutdown closing socket activity ignore exceptions
    clock tracking is jumping
      slowing clock slew to 0.1s/s
      target half the error each 30 seconds (instead of all)

4-1-152b clock slewing 5/2013

    fixed clock slew (was frozen)
    added fingerprint

4-1-152a remote TCP beta 5/2013

    adding TCP remote synchronization in this version.
    cleaning out old remote sync code
    changing threads to use threading library (slightly higher level)
    reinstated rem_adr and added flags for tcp server and client
    replacing and rewriting network sections to add TCP
    updated to ADIF 2.27
    added countdown to testQ reports
    filtered response of RCVP FAIL as it would flicker in some cases
      when there was no problem
    added "NET OK" when GOTA Q's are zero
    adapted versioning in messages to new scheme (broken since after x.y versions)
    improving .ba command
    problems with utf strings, sockets traced to sqlite unicode, useful article:
      http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2392732/sqlite-python-unicode-and-non-utf-data
    problems with windows firewall, make sure python is allowed
    broadcasts working over tcp
    filling working over tcp, slowed it from 10hz to 5hz to reduce repeats
    added fingerprint function to output md5 hexdigest of fdlog.py at startup
    changed to use real 'from' address for fills to avoid NAT issues
    testing progress thanks to W6AKB and N6OI:
      1-146, 1-149, 4-152a FDLog versions with python 2.6 and 2.7, UDP and TCP
      up to 4 stations at once
      FDGroup testing further
      one problem noted on Mac by RichF, adding participants doesn't add to pulldown
        not reproduced on w6akb mac

4-1-151 more sqlite beta 5/12/2013

    make database fdlog.sq3 for global value storage (replacing textfile)
    store time offset in global database so a restart doesn't jump the time
    added in memory cache for global database to reduce file i/o
    changing build to release, only increments when
      released to others or checkpointed
    added code to ignore short w1aw file placeholder in scoring final entry
    changed FDLOG to FDLog
    various general tidying up (minor)
    changed (c) to Copyright since (c) is not legal
    commented out remote UDP broadcast code (unfinished code)
    considering putting in remote TCP code instead - soon

4-1-150 sqlite beta 2013/05/11 database upgrade

    adding sqlite log database (keeping text file journal, but db is primary)
    conforming to proposed new version numbering system

1-149-02 2011/07/11 bug fix

    allow lowercase contest names
    added 900 mhz to editing validation
    note that report requires 4 chars in editor to save
    editor shows unvalidated fields in yellow after save attempt
    edit dialog box disappears on successful save, else stays with yellow
    fields that need fixing.
    note that this version is not reporting version number in the
      status packets correctly, shows up as 'v' with no value
      likely has been this way since 1.147 due to old regexp
    
1-149 2011/07/02 contest set version

    adding .set contst menu for (FD,VHF)
        set global to contest type .set contst FD|VHF
        adjust dup check to call for FD, and include /<grid> for VHF
    adjust bands for VHF, include 900, (drop below 6m?)
        dropping bands is tricky, leave for later.
        did add 900 band however

    setup for mercurial, opened Google Code project

1-148vf 2011/06/25 fd version

    commented out VHF code but kept other changes for 2011 fday

1-148v 2010/08/18 vhf version

    dup checking includes call/grid
    call column widened by 1 char to handle additional width
    still need to enter something in the report, such as signal strength
    fixed some small bugs in log color and editing due to dependence
    on data in the scrollbox. May be only one line change to
    make compatible with standard Field Day.

    q just needs call/grid & band (use same mode for all Qs)
    got it to work.
    added a column to make call/grid fit
    fixed a few bugs
    newline on log missing, added it, later removed again

    now two bugs. (fixed)
    local log color=blue not working
    - always black
    edit left mouse click for edit on log not working
    - probably getting error at some point and killing that thread/window
    - problem was two functions that pick up chars from msg buffer
    - adjust them by 1 char, worked

    note that python is complaining about md5 and using hashlib instead.
    snap 9, release 3 at this point

    also after space input didn't echo call with full grid. Fixed.
    converted from md5 library to hashlib. done.
    snap 10 release 4

    made call box in edit dig wider to accommodate 11 char call/grid
    added code to disallow editing another node's Qs
    after changing node id and restarting the q's still came up blue? bug?
    test code was still in. fixed.
    snap 11

    comment cleanup. added more notes detail.

    max of 20 transmitters is not enforced by the program
    educational activity is not scored by the program.
    complex GOTA bonus points are not handled by the program

1.146B has GOTA call fixed. 6/15/2008 AKB
        gcall will accept a proper call with number, somewhere prior to this
        the number part of the regex got lost. This affects log output.

     mv todo, etc to notes.txt file. approx 7 days effort in. 915 lines

1.8  sped up fill and rcvr threads
     rcvr blocked on read - no delay. filling works fast now
     debug mode slows fill requestor, otherwist fills at 10hz
     fixed propagation of broadcast info. works fairly well..

1.4  (in cvs) net sync works! approx 5 days fte effort so far

     Initial revision (to CVS)

Program History (Pre-CVS)

Re-coding started 3/6/2002 Alan K Biocca WB6ZQZ (wb6zqz@arrl.net)
Design based on fdlog.c, by same author starting in 1984 for CP/M.

Goal: a minimum keystroke field day logging program supporting
      a group of users (a whole FD site) simultaneously

The original program was multitasking and supported multiple
stations on serial terminals, 2000 lines of small C and asm.
With help from Eric Williams WD6CMU and Steve Wilson KA6S, it
devolved to MSDOS but there supported only one user, so the
database had to be manually collated to include all stations.

Plan: use networking, usually 802.11b peer-to-peer wireless,
   to interconnect the stations. use a flood/fill algorithm
   to share data. avoid single point failure, stations can join
   and depart the network with minimal effect.

v0.01 started 3/2002. chose python as it has the features
   to do this project well and efficiently
   after 2.5 days of effort the program is working for a
   single station. useful for single station logging
